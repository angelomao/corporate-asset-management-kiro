## Tips and Best Practices

### QR Code Placement
- Place QR codes in easily accessible locations
- Avoid placing on curved surfaces (QR codes may not scan well)
- Protect QR codes with clear laminate or protective covering
- Ensure QR codes are visible but not obstructing device vents or ports

### Scanning Tips
- Ensure good lighting when scanning
- Hold the camera steady
- Keep the QR code flat and fully visible
- Adjust distance if the QR code won't scan (try 6-12 inches away)

### Bulk Operations
For registering multiple devices:
1. Generate QR codes for all devices first
2. Print all QR codes at once
3. Attach QR codes to devices
4. Scan and register devices one by one

### Mobile Usage
The QR scanner works great on mobile devices:
- Use your phone's camera for scanning
- The interface is responsive and mobile-friendly
- Perfect for warehouse or field asset registration
