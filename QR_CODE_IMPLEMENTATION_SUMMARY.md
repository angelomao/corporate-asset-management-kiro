## How It Works

### QR Code Generation Flow
1. User navigates to "QR Generator" page (Admin/Manager only)
2. Fills in device information (name, serial number, category)
3. Clicks "Generate QR Code"
4. System creates QR code containing device data
5. User can download or print the QR code
6. QR code is attached to physical device

### QR Code Scanning Flow
1. User clicks "Scan QR" button on Assets page
2. Browser requests camera permission
3. User positions QR code in camera frame
4. System decodes QR code data
5. Two scenarios:
   - **Existing Asset**: Display asset information
   - **New Device**: Pre-fill registration form with scanned data
6. User completes registration or views asset details

### Asset QR Code Generation
1. User clicks "QR Code" button next to an asset
2. System generates QR code for that specific asset
3. Modal displays QR code with download/print options
4. QR code can be attached to the physical device for quick identification

## Key Features

### 1. Camera-Based Scanning
- Uses device camera for QR code scanning
- Supports multiple cameras (front/back)
- Real-time QR code detection
- Works on mobile and desktop browsers

### 2. QR Code Generation
- Server-side QR code generation for security
- High error correction level for reliability
- Customizable size and format
- Download as PNG image
- Print-friendly format

### 3. Asset Registration
- Pre-fill form with scanned data
- Reduces manual data entry errors
- Faster asset onboarding process
- Maintains data validation

### 4. Security
- Authentication required for all QR operations
- Role-based access (Admin/Manager for generation)
- Server-side validation of QR data
- Secure camera access (HTTPS required)

## Technical Details

### QR Code Data Format
```json
{
  "type": "asset",
  "id": "asset-id",           // Optional: for existing assets
  "name": "Device Name",
  "serialNumber": "SN12345",  // Optional
  "category": "HARDWARE"
}
```

### Browser Requirements
- Modern browser with camera support
- HTTPS connection (required for camera access)
- JavaScript enabled
- Camera permissions granted

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome 53+
- Firefox 36+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+

## Testing

### Backend Tests
- QR code generation for existing assets
- QR code scanning for existing assets
- QR code scanning for new device registration
- Error handling for invalid QR codes
- Error handling for missing data

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Generate QR code for new device
- [ ] Download QR code image
- [ ] Print QR code

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators/Managers

#### Generate QR Codes for New Devices
1. Navigate to "QR Generator" in the sidebar
2. Enter device information
3. Generate and print QR codes
4. Attach to physical devices

#### Register Assets via QR Code
1. Go to Assets page
2. Click "Scan QR" button
3. Scan the QR code on the device
4. Complete the registration form
5. Submit to create the asset

#### Generate QR Codes for Existing Assets
1. Go to Assets page
2. Find the asset
3. Click "QR Code" button
4. Download or print the QR code

### For Users
- View asset information by scanning QR codes
- Quick access to asset details
- No manual data entry required

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
- Ensure HTTPS connection
- Check browser camera permissions
- Try different camera if available
- Close other apps using camera

### QR Code Not Scanning
- Improve lighting conditions
- Hold camera steady
- Adjust distance to QR code
